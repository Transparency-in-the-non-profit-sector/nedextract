    the frequency of keywords in relevant sentences and the surrounding context. Sub job categories
    are determined based on keywords directly adjacent to the person's name. For the position of director,
    additional checks are applied.

    The following steps are taken:
    1. Identify names of people with potenitally siginiticant functions
    2. For each name:
     - collect relevant sentences and surrounding sentences
     - determine main job category
     - detemine sub job catergory
     - select 'main' name of a person from a list of found synonyms
     - additional check for persons identified as ambassador
     - set b_position and add people with main cat diredcteur, bestuur or rvt to a list of corresponding potential memebrs.
    3. For the position of director, an additional filter is applied. They are not considered directors if:
        - the subposition (obtained from words directly surrounding name) is not director.
        - there are two or more potential directors and they do not pass the check director check in the director_check function
